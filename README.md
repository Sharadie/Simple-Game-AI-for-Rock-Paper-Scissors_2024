## 📌 Problem Statement
This project implements an AI-powered Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The AI predicts the player's next move based on their previous choices and selects an optimal counter-move accordingly.

## 📜 Introduction
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game where players simultaneously choose one of three moves: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The rules are:
- **Rock beats Scissors**
- **Scissors beats Paper**
- **Paper beats Rock**

This AI-powered version enhances the traditional game by analyzing the player's last move and making an informed decision instead of randomly selecting a move.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **User Input**: The player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. **AI Choice**: The AI picks a move based on the player's previous selection.
3. **Winner Determination**: The game checks the result and declares the winner.
4. **Replay Option**: The user can choose to play multiple rounds.
